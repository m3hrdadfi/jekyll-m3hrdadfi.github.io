I'm doing research on how large language models work under the hood â€” tracing and editing their internal representations to make them more interpretable and controllable. I focus on mechanistic interpretability, causal analysis, and behavior editing in LLMs. 

<!-- Here, you'll find:
- My latest publications and research projects
- Topics for thesis supervision (feel free to reach out!)
- Occasional notes on AI, interpretability, and teaching -->

Curious about how LLMs really think? Let's dig in.
