You can propose your own topic (especially if it comes from industry) or simply contact me â€” we'll set up a meeting to discuss possible directions and ideas.

Some example topics I'm especially excited about include:

- Mechanistic interpretability
- Behavior steering and editing in LLMs
- Agentic AI and autonomous behavior analysis

Feel free to pitch your own idea too ...
